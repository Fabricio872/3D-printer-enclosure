## Assembly instructions

 1. Hinge assembly

      1. Insert nut into bottom of a hinge (hinge.stl) part with screwdriver
      > put screw onto a nut it will help you keep nut straight as you will push it into bottom of a hinge

      ![Hinge nut insertion](/instructionImages/hingeNutInsertion.png)

      1. Insert nut into a hinge corner part (edgeHinge.stl, edgeHingeBottom.stl)

      ![Hinge corner nut insertion](/instructionImages/hingeEdgeNutInsertion.png)

      1. Place hinge part onto hinge corner as shown on picture

      ![Hinge assembly 1](/instructionImages/hingeAssembly1.png)

      1. Screw bolt into nut inserted in hinge edge and hinge nut and after rotating hinge to normal position it should move freely

      ![Hinge assembly 2](/instructionImages/hingeAssembly2.png)

      1. Hinge should be complete now repeat this process for bottom hinge part

 1. Magnet edge part assembly

      1. Insert nuts into a magnet cover (magnetBackCover.stl)

      ![Magnet part insertion](/instructionImages/magnetCover.png)

      1. Put 18mm magnet into a magnet place on magnet corner part (edgeFront.stl) and screw magnet cover on top of magnet to hold it in place

      ![Magnet part assembly](/instructionImages/magnetCornerAssembly.png)

 1. Door magnet part assembly

      1. Insert nuts on inner part of glass cover (magnetGlassBackCover.stl)

      ![Magnet part assembly](/instructionImages/doormagnetInner.png)

      1. Drill holes into door plexi glass
      > use outer magnet part as a stencil for drilling holes for screws

      > do this on 2 corners of door glass that shares one edge of a glass

      ![Magnet part assembly](/instructionImages/drillingGlassDoorMagnet.png)

      1. Place 18mm magnet into a magnet place on outer part of glass cover (magnetGlassBackCover.stl)

      ![Magnet part assembly](/instructionImages/magnetGlassCover.png)

      1. Put bolts through holes on outer part of glass cover and then through plexi glass and finally screw them into a inner part of glass cover (magnetGlassBackCover.stl)

      > repeat this for both pre-drilled corners

      ![Magnet part assembly](/instructionImages/magnetGlassAssembly.png)

 1. Finish assembling

      1. Insert nuts into a all remaining hexagonal holes on edge parts and hinge parts

      ![Magnet part assembly](/instructionImages/edgeNuts.png)

      ![Magnet part assembly](/instructionImages/hingeNuts.png)

      1. Use one of the corner part as a stencil to drill holes on all corners of all plexi glass parts except one used for doors

      1. For door glass use as a stencil edge part with installed hinge

      1. Put bolt on every washer (washer.stl) and hinge washer (hingeWasher.stl)

      1. Screw bolts with washer through glass into a corner part and for door part use hinge washer with screws

      1. Put nut into a door handle (handle.stl)

      > put screw onto a nut it will help you keep nut strait as you will push it into bottom of a hinge

      1. Drill hole roughly in a middle between magnet corners on doors and use last remaining screw and washer to secure handle in place
